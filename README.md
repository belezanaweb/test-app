# Test-App

Aplication make in React-Native, because i use a blocked macbook, i cant connect to try in a endpoint, because that i prefer mock a return in a array.

## Installation

Start project with npm i and run on iOS Simulator.

```bash
npm i && react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 5s"
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Because i was new in Jest i prefer make test in right time and make a upgrade in a next upgrade os code.
