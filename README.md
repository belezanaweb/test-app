Project to evaluate Beleza na Web Team.

:heavy_check_mark:  **TypeScript**: I'm working with TypeScript for the latest six months. I believe that it helps with documentation of code and decreases mental effort to understand the code.


:heavy_check_mark: **Context API** : I work day-to-day with Rematch, but in this case, I prefer to use Context API because it's... simple! Besides that, I see more benefits to use it, for example, fewer configurations and fewer steps to environment setup. By the way, I have been noticing that the community has been giving up the Redux also.

:heavy_check_mark: **styled-components**: 
The reason I chose the styled-components, it very simple and productive to create components.


**Install dependencies:**

    yarn 
or

    npm install

:heavy_check_mark: **jest + react library testing** : I am initiating in tests, so I chose these tools because the community recommends.
**Run tests:**

    yarn test

**Run device**:

    yarn start

:grin: **Plus:**
**Plop:** It is a little tool that saves you time and also helps to create new files with consistency.


**create templates:**
 `generate <component>`
generate: component, styles and test:

:green_heart: **CI e DependaBot**: These tools help to maintain an updated and reliable repository.

:construction: points for improvement:
- responsive layout (or adaptative, I don't know).
- tests: I am initiating with tests, I need to get my tests level up. 




I really hope you like it.    :pray:
